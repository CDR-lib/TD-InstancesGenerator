# Benchmarking Instances Generator for Aircraft Conflict Resolution
Aircraft Conflict Resolution is one of the major tasks of computer-aided Air Traffic Management and represents a challenging optimization problem. This code generates benchmarking instances, each of them consisting of a set of flights with initial positions and vectors of velocities.

You will be able to generate:
. Predefined 2D and 3D scenarios, including flow patterns and single encounter patterns.
. Random 2D and 3D scenarios
. Pseudo-random 2D and 3D scenarios, where the trajectories meet a predefined traffic congestion.
